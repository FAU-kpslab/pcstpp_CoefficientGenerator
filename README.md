## Description

This program was implemented to calculate the transformations for our paper [L. Lenke, A. Schellenberger, K. P. Schmidt,
'Series expansions in closed and open quantum many-body systems with multiple quasiparticle types", (2023)
arXiv:2302.01000 [cond-mat.str-el]](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2302.01000).
This includes the coefficients $C_\mathbf{m} := F(\infty; \mathbf{m})$, not the subsequent linked-cluster expansion.

## Instructions

> These are instructions for the coefficient generator for pcst<sup>++</sup>, not for the method pcst<sup>++</sup>
> itself. For that, we refer to our paper [arXiv:2302.01000](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2302.01000).
